        <p>
          This booking app provides service businesses with a fully customizable
          scheduling solution. Owners can set weekly schedules, special hours,
          and extended days off.
        </p>
        <p>
          There{"'"}s also a very intuitive schedule UI that allows staff
          members to visualize their weekly schedule. In addition to that, there
          is also a services section which allows admins to quickly add, edit,
          or delete services offered by the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client side booking flow is also very intuitive, allowing the user
          to seamlessly select their provider, service, and appointment date.
          The interface is fully responsive and includes a dark mode option for
          enhanced usability.

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Process</h2>
        <p>
          The first step in developing this booking app was creating a front-end
          interface for admins to submit their availabilities. The form logic
          and styling was done with React and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously, I set up the database and defined models for admins,
          users, availabilities, appointments, and all other models necessary
          for the booking flow. I used PostgreSQL as the database and Prisma as
          the ORM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was using NextJS, I was able to create server-side actions to
          handle CRUD operations on availabilities, services and appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          After creating the models and back-end logic, I continued working on
          the front-end UI to create visualizations of the availabilities and
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also included an optional integration with Twilio and SendGrid to
          allow for text message and email notifications for upcoming
          appointments.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Dealing with dates and times are an absolute headache. So instead of
          reinventing the wheel, I used date-fns. That helped standardize the
          dates and times, but it was still quite difficult integrating it with
          the admin schedule and calendar client.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another hurdle that took quite a bit of time overcoming was showing
          availabilities based off of the admin{"'"}s schedule and existing
          appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had to spend a lot of time making sure appointments don{"â€™"}t
          overlap and that availabilities accommodate for the selected service
          time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Lesson Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This was the first application that I built for someone else and not
          myself. I had to be a lot more rigorous when testing different
          scenarios to make sure appointments and availabilities don{"'"}t
          conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          With multiple NextJS projects under my belt, I was able to build this
          application much quicker, with most of the time spent on the date and
          time logic.
